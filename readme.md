This repository contains a straightforward video calling application built using Node.js and React.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: You can download the latest LTS version for your operating system from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is installed automatically along with Node.js. To verify its installation, run the following command in your terminal:

 ```sh
 npm -v
 ```

### Clone Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepthapliyal/Videocalling
```

Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor.

### Install Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for both the server and the frontend, run the following command in the terminal within the project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand command:

```sh
npm i
```

### Run the Server

To start the server, run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
nodemon .
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```sh
nodemon index.js
```

# Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `Wesee` folder to set up the frontend part of the application.

## Install Dependencies

Inside the `Wesee` folder, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Once again, you can use the shorthand:

```sh
npm i
```

## Run Development Server

To run the development server for the frontend, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Access the Application

With both the server and frontend running, you can access the application by opening `localhost:3000` in two separate tabs on your web browser. This will enable video calling functionality between the tabs.

Enjoy seamless video calls using this simple application! If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the repository's documentation or seek assistance from the community.
